Coffee will wake you up but also quench your thirst.
There are different types of coffee, Arabica and Robusta.
But since you donâ€™t really care about that, you just go
to the coffee shop and ask for a coffee, which they
will happily provide.

You will then drink the coffee to both wake you up
and quench your thirst.

Implement this in a program.
