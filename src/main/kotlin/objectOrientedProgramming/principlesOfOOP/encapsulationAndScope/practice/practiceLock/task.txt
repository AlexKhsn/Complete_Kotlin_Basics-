A class EncryptionLock has a privateKey, which is private.
A method unlock takes a publicKey and applies a private function to it.
The private function is a math formula. If the result matches privateKey,
it returns true, otherwise it returns false.

Implement this in a program and try multiply keys to unlock the lock.
